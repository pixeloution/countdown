# countdown.js

We seem to have to put up a lot of sites where the amount of time to some event happening
has to be calculated, usually in the format of

    * 24 day 12 hours 22 minutes Left!

So this is a simple library that returns the amount of time left between two dates (the
web browser's "now" and the date specified) in:

  * days
  * hours
  * minutes


For example, the countdown to 25 hours from now will return 01 days, 01 hours, 00 minutes.


## Usage Example

    countdown = new Countdown('February 29, 2012 5:15 PM');
    console.log(countdown);

## Return Value

The return value is a generic object with the following 3 properties:

    object.days
    object.hours
    object.minutes

Numbers less then 10 are 0 padded, so 8 minutes returns '08'
